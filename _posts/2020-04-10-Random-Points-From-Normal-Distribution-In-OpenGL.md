## Creating a Normal Distribution


I will be using a pseudorandom generated set of points that can serve to test multiple algorithms that use points in their processing step. In particular, we can use a normal distribution to generate those points. Specifically, 2D points for our 2D OpenGL baseline. In addition,  Iâ€™d prefer that the geometries created from these points fall more or less within the center of our OpenGL window. For this , I will be using a sigmoid function to map the domain $(-\infty, \infty)$ from the normal distribution to the range (-1, 1). This is the needed range since OpenGL processes our 2D coordinates in the range (-1, 1) and then transforms that to window coordinates in the range (SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT).

We can get a set of pseudorandom points using the template class std::normal_distribution from STL. Starting from an uniform random generator to get a mean and a standard deviation value, which serve as arguments for the std::normal_distribution constructor. After that we simply need to obtain the sample value that is returned from the std::normal_distribution object, and apply the sigmoid function for the mapping.   


## Implementation

At first, I decided to use the follwing sigmoid function: 

$$f(x) =  \frac{e^{2x} - 1}{e^{2x} + 1}$$

For sigmoid function, we will be using 

$$ f(x) = \frac{x}{1+ \lvert x \rvert}$$

this sigmoid function does the mapping $f(x) : (-\infty, \infty) \to (-1, 1)$.

```c++
void Normal_Distribution(float * sample) {

    static std::random_device rd;
    static std::mt19937 gen(rd());                                         // Mersenne twister PRNG
    static std::default_random_engine generator;
    static std::uniform_real_distribution<double> distribution(0.0, 1.0);

    static const float mean = distribution(generator);
    static const float std_dev = distribution(generator);
                                            
    static std::normal_distribution<float> normal_distribution(mean, std_dev); // instance of class std::normal_distribution with specific mean and stddev

    float x = normal_distribution(gen);
    *sample = x / (1 + std::abs(x)); // *sample in range (-1, 1) using sigmoid function
}
